    <p>The age old question, which is better, cats or dogs? This controversial question has bugged the internet for years now, and answering it is no easy task. Many people would say that dogs are superior due to their kind and caring nature. Others may say that cats are great pets to keep around due to calming effect they have around people. Although, there is only one true answer. </p>
    <h3>Dogs:</h3>
    <p>The question definitely is not an easy one, but narrowing it down may help find our answer. First lets start with dogs. Dogs actually provide many benefits towards humans. Most people who own a dog have lower rates of stress, higher survival rates, better blood pressure, fewer heart attacks, and generally feel less lonely. Having a dog seems to have great benefits. But what about the negatives? </p>
    <p>In terms of cons for owning a dog, there aren't many. The biggest con of owning a dog is the cost of keeping one. Dogs will often not come cheap so its important you are able to give you furry friend a nice home before you buy one. Another big con with dogs is the mess they make, dogs will often shed and cause hair to get everywhere in your home, its to be expected. Dogs also require a lot of attention so its important to keep them entertained. </p>

    <h3>Cats:</h3>
    <p>Next up are cats. Cats also provide a ton of the same benefits as dogs, as most pets do. They improve general wellbeing, lower stress and anxiety, reduce loneliness, and its said that the purr they produce can be healing. One thing about cats that is very intresting is that they can actually benefit the immune system with the microbes they carry. And while cats definitely need attention, I would argue they do not need nearly as much as dogs. </p>
    <p>The negatives of cats are up now. Again in terms of negatives, the positives seem to outway them. The biggest one for cats is the litter box, it will stink and you will have to change it out. Some other cons include them being too expensive for some people, shedding, and some cats may claw at furniture. Clawing at furniture can actually be prevented somewhat though as declawing exists, though some people would argue against it.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
    <p>So which one is better? Cats or dogs? Its the answer everyone has waited for and the answer is that, there is no answer. As expected its an opinion based question and there is no real answer. Everyone has a favorite animal so you can't just say which is better or not, but in my opinion, you can never truly know which is better until you have experienced both, so make sure you adopt from shelters and keep your friend happy and healthy.</p>
